# WebhookTampering

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**result** | **bool** | Flag indicating browser tampering was detected. This happens when either of these conditions is true:   * There are inconsistencies in the browser configuration that cross our internal tampering thresholds (indicated by `anomalyScore`).   * The browser signature resembles one of \"anti-detect\" browsers specifically designed to evade identification and fingerprinting, for example, Incognition (indicated by `antiDetectBrowser`).  | [optional] 
**anomaly_score** | **float** | Confidence score (`0.0 - 1.0`) for tampering detection:   * Values above `0.5` indicate that there was a tampering attempt   * Values below `0.5` indicate genuine browsers.  | [optional] 
**anti_detect_browser** | **bool** | Is `true` if the identified browser resembles one of \"anti-detect\" browsers, for example, Incognition. Anti-detect browsers try to evade identification by masking or manipulating their fingerprint to imitate legitimate browser configurations. | [optional]
