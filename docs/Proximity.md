# Proximity
Proximity ID represents a fixed geographical zone in a discrete global grid within which the device is observed.



## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **str** | A stable privacy-preserving identifier for a given proximity zone.  | 
**precision_radius** | **int** | The radius of the proximity zoneâ€™s precision level, in meters.  | 
**confidence** | **float** | A value between `0` and `1` representing the likelihood that the true device location lies within the mapped proximity zone.   * Scores closer to `1` indicate high confidence that the location is inside the mapped proximity zone.   * Scores closer to `0` indicate lower confidence, suggesting the true location may fall in an adjacent zone.  |
