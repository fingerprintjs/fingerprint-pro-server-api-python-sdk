# VPNMethods

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**timezone_mismatch** | **bool** | The browser timezone doesn't match the timezone inferred from the request IP address. | 
**public_vpn** | **bool** | Request IP address is owned and used by a public VPN service provider. | 
**auxiliary_mobile** | **bool** | This method applies to mobile devices only. Indicates the result of additional methods used to detect a VPN in mobile devices. | 
**os_mismatch** | **bool** | The browser runs on a different operating system than the operating system inferred from the request network signature. | 
**relay** | **bool** | Request IP address belongs to a relay service provider, indicating the use of relay services like [Apple Private relay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602) or [Cloudflare Warp](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/).   * Like VPNs, relay services anonymize the visitor's true IP address. * Unlike traditional VPNs, relay services don't let visitors spoof their location by choosing an exit node in a different country.  This field allows you to differentiate VPN users and relay service users in your fraud prevention logic.  |
