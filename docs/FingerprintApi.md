# **analyze_request_for_automation_intelligence**
> EventEdge analyze_request_for_automation_intelligence(edge_request)

Collect Automation Intelligence.

The Automation Intelligence API gives you the tools to determine whether traffic is legitimate and should be accepted by your application.

This feature is currently in a Public Preview testing phase. All feedback is welcome! If you encounter any issues, please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/).

The API detects automation tools like AI Agents, AI Assistants, AI Browsers, and other bots. Additionally, it provides IP intelligence like geolocation, residential proxy, VPN and data center detection.

Automation Intelligence is derived from HTTP request metadata that reaches your server. It does not require the use of a JavaScript client-side agent or mobile SDKs to collect device context.

The API is fast, with average response times of less than 30ms, making it a great fit for edge, pre-origin or middleware contexts. The API is platform-agnostic and can be used with different CDN providers, cloud platforms, or any server backend.

Because this API doesn’t require the use of a client-side device collection agent, it doesn’t support device identification via `visitor_id` and a few Smart Signals derived from deep device telemetry.

### Event Retrieval

Events created by the Automation Intelligence API can be fetched via the [`/v4/events/{event_id}`](https://docs.fingerprint.com/reference/server-api-get-event) API using the `event_id` present in the API response.

Fetch all Automation Intelligence API events via the [`/v4/events?source=edge`](https://docs.fingerprint.com/reference/server-api-search-events#parameter-source) API.

# **delete_visitor_data**
> delete_visitor_data(visitor_id)

Delete a visitor ID

Use this API to request the deletion of all data associated with a specific visitor ID.

Upon a request to delete data for a visitor ID,
- The data collected from the corresponding browser (or device) will be deleted asynchronously, typically within a few minutes. This data will no longer be available to identify this browser (or device). When the same browser (or device) revisits, it will receive a new visitor ID.
- The identification events made from this browser (or device) in the past 10 days are typically deleted within 24 hrs. 
- The identification events made from this browser (or device) outside of the 10 days will be purged as per your [data retention period](https://docs.fingerprint.com/docs/regions#data-retention).

The following timeline illustrates which events are deleted and which remain after a DELETE API request:
```
Day 1:  First visit from browser A. (Assigned visitor ID: VID1000)
Day 2:  Browser A revisits. (Assigned the same visitor ID: VID1000)
Day 13: Browser A revisits. (Assigned the same visitor ID: VID1000)
Day 14: Delete VID1000
Day 15: Browser A re-visits. (Assigned a different visitor ID: VID9999)
Day 15: GET /events/day-13 (Returns 404. The event is within the 10 days of deleting VID1000 and will have been deleted)
Day 16: GET /events/day-2 (Returns 200. The event is outside of the 10 days of deleting VID1000 and is still available)
```

### Availability
This API is available only for Enterprise plans **upon request**. If you are interested, please [contact our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/).

### Rate limits and daily quota

Search events

## Search

The `/v4/events` endpoint provides a convenient way to search for past events based on specific parameters. Typical use cases and queries include:

- Searching for events associated with a single `visitor_id` within a time range to get historical behavior of a visitor.
- Searching for events associated with a single `linked_id` within a time range to get all events associated with your internal account identifier.
- Excluding all bot traffic from the query (`good` and `bad` bots)

By default, the API searches events from the last 7 days, sorts them by newest first and returns the last 10 events.

- Use `start` and `end` to specify the time range of the search.
- Use `reverse=true` to sort the results oldest first.
- Use `limit` to specify the number of events to return.
- Use `pagination_key` to get the next page of results if there are more than `limit` events.

### Filtering events with the `suspect` flag

The `/v4/events` endpoint unlocks a powerful method for fraud protection analytics. The `suspect` flag is exposed in all events where it was previously set by the update API.

You can also apply the `suspect` query parameter as a filter to find all potentially fraudulent activity that you previously marked as `suspect`. This helps identify patterns of fraudulent behavior.

### Environment scoping

If you use a secret key that is scoped to an environment, you will only get events associated with the same environment. With a workspace-scoped environment, you will get events from all environments.

Smart Signals not activated for your workspace or are not included in the response.

)

# Create an instance of the API class
api_instance = fingerprint_server_sdk.FingerprintApi(configuration)

limit: int = 10 # Maximum number of events to return. Defaults to 10 when omitted. Results are selected from the time range (`start`, `end`), ordered by `reverse`, then truncated to provided `limit` size. So `reverse=true` returns the oldest N=`limit` events, otherwise the newest N=`limit` events.  (optional)
pagination_key: str = 'S9rgMMUb4z3X5t5pr_tSgoSZlmyF0O8X7kCV2m981-iY1LmRTjraa1rTk3L-hQExnDWCi0RA-zAIjaVSTNO2AN2eqQWgzT0RjbieMxRfSdkM-HmOhdOgdQvYfPG3vqU1DJKh4Q' # Use `pagination_key` to get the next page of results.  When more results are available (e.g., you requested up to 100 results for your query using `limit`, but there are more than 100 events total matching your request), the `pagination_key` field is added to the response. The pagination key is an arbitrary string that should not be interpreted in any way and should be passed as-is. In the following request, use that value in the `pagination_key` parameter to get the next page of results:  1. First request, returning most recent 100 events: `GET api-base-url/events?limit=100` 2. Use `response.pagination_key` to get the next page of results: `GET api-base-url/events?limit=100&pagination_key=S9rgMMUb4z3X5t5pr_tSgoSZlmyF0O8X7kCV2m981-iY1LmRTjraa1rTk3L-hQExnDWCi0RA-zAIjaVSTNO2AN2eqQWgzT0RjbieMxRfSdkM-HmOhdOgdQvYfPG3vqU1DJKh4Q`  (optional)

Filter events by matching Visitor ID (`identification.visitor_id` property).  (optional)
high_recall_id: str = 'Ibk1527CUFmcnjLwIs4A9' # The High Recall ID is a supplementary browser identifier designed for use cases that require wider coverage over precision. Compared to the standard visitor ID, the High Recall ID strives to match incoming browsers more generously (rather than precisely) with existing browsers and thus identifies fewer browsers as new. The High Recall ID is best suited for use cases that are sensitive to browsers being identified as new and where mismatched browsers are not detrimental.  Filter events by matching High Recall ID (`supplementary_id_high_recall.visitor_id` property).  (optional)

Other notations like comma-separated or bracket notation are not supported.  (optional)
bot_info_provider: List[str] = ['bot_info_provider_example'] # Filter events by their Bot Info Provider. The provider must match exactly, partial or wildcard matching is not supported.  Multiple Providers can be provided using the repeated keys syntax. For example, `bot_info_provider=OpenAI&bot_info_provider=AWS`, will match events with a Bot Info Provider of `OpenAI` or `AWS`.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **limit** | **int**| Maximum number of events to return. Defaults to 10 when omitted. Results are selected from the time range (`start`, `end`), ordered by `reverse`, then truncated to provided `limit` size. So `reverse=true` returns the oldest N=`limit` events, otherwise the newest N=`limit` events.  | [optional] 
 **pagination_key** | **str**| Use `pagination_key` to get the next page of results.  When more results are available (e.g., you requested up to 100 results for your query using `limit`, but there are more than 100 events total matching your request), the `pagination_key` field is added to the response. The pagination key is an arbitrary string that should not be interpreted in any way and should be passed as-is. In the following request, use that value in the `pagination_key` parameter to get the next page of results:  1. First request, returning most recent 100 events: `GET api-base-url/events?limit=100` 2. Use `response.pagination_key` to get the next page of results: `GET api-base-url/events?limit=100&pagination_key=S9rgMMUb4z3X5t5pr_tSgoSZlmyF0O8X7kCV2m981-iY1LmRTjraa1rTk3L-hQExnDWCi0RA-zAIjaVSTNO2AN2eqQWgzT0RjbieMxRfSdkM-HmOhdOgdQvYfPG3vqU1DJKh4Q`  | [optional] 
 **visitor_id** | **str**| Unique [visitor identifier](https://docs.fingerprint.com/reference/js-agent-get-function#visitor_id) issued by Fingerprint Identification and all active Smart Signals.  Filter events by matching Visitor ID (`identification.visitor_id` property).  | [optional] 
 **high_recall_id** | **str**| The High Recall ID is a supplementary browser identifier designed for use cases that require wider coverage over precision. Compared to the standard visitor ID, the High Recall ID strives to match incoming browsers more generously (rather than precisely) with existing browsers and thus identifies fewer browsers as new. The High Recall ID is best suited for use cases that are sensitive to browsers being identified as new and where mismatched browsers are not detrimental.  Filter events by matching High Recall ID (`supplementary_id_high_recall.visitor_id` property).  | [optional] 
 **bot** | [**SearchEventsBot**](.md)| Filter events by the Bot Detection result, specifically:   `all` - events where any kind of bot was detected.   `good` - events where a good bot was detected.   `bad` - events where a bad bot was detected.   `none` - events where no bot was detected. > Note: When using this parameter, only events with the `bot` property set to a valid value are returned. Events without a `bot` Smart Signal result are left out of the response.  | [optional] 
 **bot_info** | [**SearchEventsBotInfo**](.md)| Filter events by their Bot Info result, specifically:   - `all` - events where any kind of bot was detected.   - `none` - events where no bot was detected, and no `bot_info` was present.  | [optional] 
 **bot_info_category** | [**List[BotInfoCategory]**](BotInfoCategory.md)| Filter events by their Bot Info Category.  Multiple categories can be provided using the repeated keys syntax. For example, `bot_info_category=ai_agent&bot_info_category=ai_assistant`, will match events with a Bot Info Category of `ai_agent` or `ai_assistant`. Other notations like comma-separated or bracket notation are not supported.  | [optional] 
 **bot_info_identity** | [**List[BotInfoIdentity]**](BotInfoIdentity.md)| Filter events by their Bot Info Identity type.  Multiple identity types can be provided using the repeated keys syntax. For example, `bot_info_identity=verified&bot_info_identity=signed`, will match events with a Bot Info Identity of `verified` or `signed`. Other notations like comma-separated or bracket notation are not supported.  | [optional] 
 **bot_info_confidence** | [**List[BotInfoConfidence]**](BotInfoConfidence.md)| Filter events by their Bot Info Confidence.  Multiple confidences can be provided using the repeated keys syntax. For example, `bot_info_confidence=high&bot_info_confidence=medium`, will match events with a Bot Info Confidence of `high` or `medium`. Other notations like comma-separated or bracket notation are not supported.  | [optional] 
 **bot_info_provider** | [**List[str]**](str.md)| Filter events by their Bot Info Provider. The provider must match exactly, partial or wildcard matching is not supported.  Multiple Providers can be provided using the repeated keys syntax. For example, `bot_info_provider=OpenAI&bot_info_provider=AWS`, will match events with a Bot Info Provider of `OpenAI` or `AWS`. Other notations like comma-separated or bracket notation are not supported.  | [optional] 
 **bot_info_name** | [**List[str]**](str.md)| Filter events by their Bot Info Name. The name must match exactly, partial or wildcard matching is not supported.

For example, `bot_info_name=ChatGPT%20Agent&bot_info_name=Bedrock%20AgentCore`, will match events with a Bot Info Name of `ChatGPT Agent` or `Bedrock AgentCore`. Other notations like comma-separated or bracket notation are not supported.  | [optional] 
 **ip_address** | **str**| Filter events by IP address or IP range (if CIDR notation is used). If CIDR notation is not used, a /32 for IPv4 or /128 for IPv6 is assumed. Examples of range based queries: 10.0.0.0/24, 192.168.0.1/32  | [optional] 
 **asn** | **str**| Filter events by the ASN associated with the event's IP address. This corresponds to the `ip_info.(v4|v6).asn` property in the response.  | [optional] 
 **linked_id** | **str**| Filter events by your custom identifier.  You can use [linked Ids](https://docs.fingerprint.com/reference/js-agent-get-function#linkedid) to associate identification requests with your own identifier, for example, session Id, purchase Id, or transaction Id. You can then use this `linked_id` parameter to retrieve all events associated with your custom identifier.  | [optional]

# **update_event**
> update_event(event_id, event_update)

Update an event

Change information in existing events specified by `event_id` or *flag suspicious events*.

When an event is created, it can be assigned `linked_id` and `tags` submitted through the JS agent parameters. 
This information might not have been available on the client initially, so the Server API permits updating these attributes after the fact.

**Warning** It's not possible to update events older than one month. 

**Warning** Trying to update an event immediately after creation may temporarily result in an 
error (HTTP 409 Conflict. The event is not mutable yet.) as the event is fully propagated across our systems. In such a case, simply retry the request.


### Example

event_id: str = '1708102555327.NLOjmg' # The unique event [identifier](https://docs.fingerprint.com/reference/js-agent-get-function#event_id).
event_update: EventUpdate = fingerprint_server_sdk.EventUpdate() # 

try:
    # Update an event
    api_instance.update_event(event_id, event_update)
